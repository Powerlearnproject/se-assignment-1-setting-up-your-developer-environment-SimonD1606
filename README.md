# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

Developer Environment Setup Guide
This document outlines the steps taken to set up a developer environment for SimonD1606 Demo Project. It includes details on software installations, configurations, customizations, and troubleshooting encountered during the process.
Tasks:
1.	Operating System:
•	Selection: Windows 11 was chosen due to familiarity and project requirements (if applicable).
•	Installation: Downloaded and installed Windows 11 from the official Microsoft website: https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11
2.	Text Editor/IDE:
•	Selection: Visual Studio Code was chosen for its versatility and extensive plugin support.
•	Installation: Downloaded and installed Visual Studio Code from the official website: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
3.	Version Control System:
•	Git Installation: Installed Git from the official website and configured it on the local machine.
•	GitHub Account: Created a GitHub account (https://github.com/index.html) for hosting project repositories.
•	Git Repository: Initialized a Git repository for the project and made the first commit, by using the following steps;
Open a terminal window and initialize a Git repository for your project:
git init
Make your first commit:
o	git add .
(adds all tracked files to the staging area)
o	git commit -m "Initial commit"
(commits the staged changes)


4.	Programming Languages and Runtimes:
•	Python Installation: Installed Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/), as it's required for the project and  to verify the Python installation by opening a terminal window and typing
python --version
•	Verifying Environment: Ensured the necessary tools to build and execute Python code are available (e.g., pip).
5.	Package Manager:
•	pip Installation: Installed pip (Python Package Installer) as it's the primary package manager for Python. The Following steps used; 
Open a terminal window and install pip (Python package manager):
pip install pip
Verify the pip installation by typing
pip --version

6.	Database (Optional):
•	MySQL Installation (Optional): This step is skipped if the project doesn't require a database. If needed, download and install MySQL from the official website: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/ by using the following steps;
-	Download MySQL from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html.
-	Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
-	Create a database user and grant necessary permissions.

7.	Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
•	Virtualization (Optional): The use of virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines is not implemented in this initial setup but will be considered for future project needs. The following steps followed; 
-	Install Docker from https://www.docker.com/.
-	Create a Dockerfile for your project.
-	Build a Docker image from the Dockerfile.
-	Run the Docker image to create a container for your project.

8.	Extensions and Plugins:
•	Exploration: Explored available extensions for Visual Studio Code to enhance functionality. These may include syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and Git integration. Specific extensions installed will be documented in a separate file (e.g., extensions.txt). the following steps followed; 
-	Open the Extensions tab in Visual Studio Code.
-	Browse and install extensions such as:
o	Python: Official Python extension for syntax highlighting, linting, and debugging.
o	Git: Extension for version control integration.
o	Docker: Extension for Docker integration.


Reflection on Challenges and Strategies
Challenges Encountered:
•	Installing MySQL: Navigating MySQL configurations and ensuring successful connection to the database.
•	Setting up Git: Understanding and applying Git commands for version control.
•	Choosing the right extensions and plugins: Evaluating compatibility and selecting the most suitable ones for specific project needs.
Strategies Employed:
•	Research and Documentation: Thoroughly reading documentation and online resources to clarify setup procedures.
•	Community Support: Seeking assistance from online forums and communities to troubleshoot specific issues.
•	Testing and Iteration: Trying different approaches and making adjustments based on test results to optimize the setup.
•	.
Additional Documents:
•	A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git is https://github.com/SimonD1606/Demo.git
